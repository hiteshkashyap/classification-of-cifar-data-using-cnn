# classification-of-cifar-data-using-cnn
We will be creating convolution neural network model for classification of cifar dataset.
We will use the CIFAR10 dataset. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.
The resolution of the images are 28*28. We will be using Pytorch for this task.
Required packages for this assignment: torch, torchvision, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
